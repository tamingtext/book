Taming Text, by Grant Ingersoll, Thomas Morton and Drew Farris is
designed to teach software engineers the basic concepts of working
with text to solve search and Natural Language Processing problems.
The book focuses on teaching using existing open source libraries like
Apache Solr, Apache Mahout and Apache OpenNLP to manipulate text.  To

Getting Started
---------------

Throughout this document, TT_HOME is the directory containing the
checkout of the Taming Text code base.

Taming Text uses Maven for building and running the code.  To get
started, you will need:

1. JDK 1.6+ 
2. Maven 3.0 or higher 
3. The OpenNLP English models, available at 
   http://maven.tamingtext.com/opennlp-models/models-1.5.

   Place the models in the TT_HOME directory in a directory named
   opennlp-models. 

   This can be done by using the following commands on UNIX from the
   TT_HOME directory:

   mkdir opennlp-models 
   cd opennlp-models 
   wget -nd -np -r http://maven.tamingtext.com/opennlp-models/models-1.5/ 
   rm index.html*
   
   
   or using wget (https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/) and 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org/) on windows (both must be added to the path environment variable):
   
   md opennlp-models 
   cd opennlp-models
   wget -nd -np -r http://maven.tamingtext.com/opennlp-models/models-1.5/ 
   del index.htm*
   

4. Get WordNet 3.0 and place it in the TT_HOME directory.
   
   This can be done by using the following commands on UNIX from the
   TT_HOME directory:

   wget -nd -np -m http://maven.tamingtext.com/wordnet/
   rm index.html*
   tar -xf WordNet-3.0.tar.gz

   or using wget (https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/) and  7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org/) on windows (both must be added to the path environment variable):
   
   wget -nd -np -r http://maven.tamingtext.com/wordnet/
   del index.html*
   7z x WordNet-3.0.tar.gz
   7z x WordNet-3.0.tar

Building the Source
-------------------

Prior to building the source, for those previously unfamiliar with Maven,
it may be wise to read this to avoid future hassles:
http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html

To build the source, in TT_HOME:

   mvn clean package 

Running the Examples
--------------------

Many of the examples can be run via the 'tt' script in the TT_HOME/bin
directory. Running this script without arguments will display a list
of the example names.

Some of the samples are powered by pre-configured instances of
solr. These can be started with the TT_HOME/bin/start-solr.sh script,
which takes a single argument, the name of the instance to
start. Available instances include solr-qa, solr-clustering and
solr-tagging.
